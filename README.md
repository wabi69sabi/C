# Unit Converter

### About:
This is a basic unit converter written in C code to use as an example.
It allows the user to convert temparature, weight and numeric values.

### Intallation:
The requirements are pretty simple, as you only need to have a console and a working C compiler, such as gcc. 
Clone the repo and run the makefile:
```bash
make LINK
```
This will give you some warning output, and create an executable file called "converter".

### Run:
In order to run the program just type:
```bash
make all
```
An alternative way of executing would be to first run the installation and then just type:
```bash
./converter
```
